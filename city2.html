The same year, the leaders of the society approached the Bangalore Development Authority for the allotment of land to construct the temple. A seven-acre hillock with a huge rock in the midst of it was allotted to the ISKCON temple authorities on August 3, 1988. Since the site wasn't fit for construction, a temporary temple premise was arranged there.
